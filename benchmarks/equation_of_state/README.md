# Equation of state benchmark

[Gibbs sea water](http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm) equation of state.
The equation of state describes how certain thermodynamic parameters of sea water behave
depending on its temperature, salinity content, and ambient pressure.

This routine is embarassingly parallel and pure elementary math (i.e., a GPU's dream).
